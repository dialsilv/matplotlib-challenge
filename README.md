input data is in the repository, as well as the output pictures

Three observable trends based on the data:
1. Capomulin seems the most efective Drug within the plotted ones, with highest decrease of the tumor volume over the days,
least Metastatic Spread and highest survival rate.
2. The Metastatic Spread accross the plotted drugs has higher standard error as the time (in days) passes, showing that the
Metastatic Spread in the different mices varies considerably. However, if we look at the Tumor Response to Treatment the 
standar error are way smaller, indicating that the tumor response is very similar to all the mice that got the treatments.
3.  Compared to the drugs plotted, Infubinol has the lowest survival rate, even though it is not the worst in terms of 
Metastatic spread and tumor response to treatment. This finding could lead to a deeper analysis on the reasons for the low 
survival rate. It could for example mean that the drug itself is stronger and kills the mice faster.
